## How to Apply These Fixes

1. **Replace VoiceRecognition.tsx**:
   - Use the corrected version of VoiceRecognition.tsx we created

2. **Update AI API with Better Error Handling**:
   - Replace ai-api.ts with ai-api.ts.new for improved error handling and retry logic

3. **Update Backend Routes**:
   - Replace routes/ai.js with ai.js.new for better CORS handling and error responses

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - The VOICE_RECOGNITION_README.md has already been updated

5. **Test the Application**:
   - Start both servers (Node.js backend and Flask AI server)
   - Test voice recognition functionality

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Connection Status Indicator**:
   - Consider adding a connection status indicator in the UI to show if the backend and AI services are available

2. **Offline Mode**:
   - Implement an offline mode that still allows basic food logging without AI features

3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Add network status monitoring to automatically detect and notify when services are unavailable

4. **Local Fallbacks**:
   - Store some common AI responses locally for offline use or when services are unavailable
